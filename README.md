# Hello-world
This is just for the fun

testing the brance flow :-)

Her er en liste over de værktøjer jeg skal bruge for at arbejde  med unity fra flere computere...

When working on a project in a Team Collaboration setup you have the requirement for one central location of the project source, 

Hosted Git Services:
GitHub --- GitHub really started the online platform we have today. We recommend this service for Open Source projects, were the source is publicly shared.

There's a few tools used very commonly in the Unity workflow, and since we used them while authoring this article we decided to go ahead and promote them. Only Git SCM and Git LFS is required in order to follow along. Install each one you would like in order they are listed, if you already have one installed you can skip it. While installing each one the default selections perfectly fine, there are only a few screens we want to point out.

Software used:
Visual Studio --- A software development IDE built by Microsoft, this tool is extremely powerful. Unity allows you to write in C# (provides the best performance), and you can link VS to be your script editor in Unity.

Unity --- Unity is game development platform, both the IDE and the Engine. It offers a free solution up to around $100k+ yearly profit.

Git SCM --- This is the framework required in order to start working with Git SCM. A lot is packed into this very powerful toolkit.

Git LFS --- Git LFS is a Git module that expands it support for handling large non text based binary files. FBX Models, PSDs, etc. It's 
needed in order to work with Unity game projects and Source Control.

SourceTree --- SourceTree offers a nice easy to use GUI for Git, it simplifies the process even more.
