Her er en liste over de værktøjer jeg skal bruge for at arbejde  med unity fra flere computere...

When working on a project in a Team Collaboration setup you have the requirement for one central location of the project source, and the ability for everyone to make their changes and sync up with the central and the other teammates. Git SCM does just that, it is an extremely powerful tool and we only touch the tip of the ice-burg in this article. Syncing the source is best done over the internet, and there are four main free solutions we would like to recommend. We will be using GitHub during the article how-to.

Hosted Git Services:
GitHub --- GitHub really started the online platform we have today. We recommend this service for Open Source projects, were the source is publicly shared.
Bitbucket --- Bitbucket is another big platform that has almost equal features (and more) then GitHub. We recommend this service for Private Source project, only authorized users can view the projects. Bitbucket offers even more solutions, Ticketing (help, defects, etc), Continuous Integration and more.
Visual Studio Team Services --- VSTS is an amazing platform, it could be compared to Bitbucket very closely. Similar offerings and even things BB doesn't have.
Self Hosted, ex. GitLab --- GitLab is often called a "GitHub" clone, its software you can download and install on your own server.
